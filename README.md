Case Study assignment due 03202021

## Overview and Origin:

The name of the company for this case study is Factom, Inc.

Factom, Inc. was founded in 2014. It is a separate legal entity from the Factom Protocol. 

The founders of the company are Paul Snow and David Johnston. (1)

The idea for Factom came about when the founders discovered Bitcoin did not offer a way to encrypt and verify data to their satisfaction. (2)

Although Factom declared bankruptcy in 2020, it is still functioning and is funded by the revenue of its largest client. (3)
Once I discovered this fact while researching, I was interested in finding out why this promising company failed.
The total funding before bankruptcy was $15.5M. (4)

## Business Activities:

Factom is not specifically solving a financial problem, although they most likely produced a product that was not prohibitively expensive. Factom created a blockchain protocol solution for public and private data. This protocol would allow encryption, verification, and synchronization with other data. (5)

Factom's intended customers are large scale companies and government entities. The solution that Factom offers that their competitors do not offer is, I believe, easy incorporation into legacy systems. 

Anil John, a director of the science and technology arm of the Department of Homeland Security, said, when rewarding Factom with a grant to secure data from security cameras at the United States southern border, "... Factom's work has informed architecture choices and design decisions inherent in integrating blockchain with existing technologies". (6)

The protocol Factom uses the Bitcoin blockchain and not the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, thereby avoiding the typical slow response time of Bitcoin transactions. (7)

## Landscape:

The domain of the financial industry Factom is in is Blockchain technology.

There are scores of major trends and innovations in the blockchain domain over the last ten years. The biggest major trend in blockchain technology is the proliferation of Bitcoin. It is aptly described by the Founder of Microstrategy, Michael Saylor, as "the apex property of the human race" (Microstrategy is currently the second largest institutional holder of Bitcoin). (8)

The top three companies in this domain, by market capitalization, as of March 19, 2021, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. (9)

## Results:

Despite filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Factom retained its largest client, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Its business impact for the foundation has been to encrypt and maintain internationally distributed medical records, especially those from third-world countries. (10) 

Factom's business impact for DHS (before bankruptcy) uploaded data from sensors and security cameras located on the souther border to the blockchain. This is done successfully in spite of an environment with limited connectivity and severe weather conditions. (11)

There are several core metrics that blockchain companies use. (12) I believe the Vital Statistics section of the Factom Protocol's website contains many important features, such as Block Length, Node Operators, and Block Height. However, I believe the number of Node Operators is key. The Node Operators metric shows how many nodes, like computers, are holding the full transaction history of the blockchain. The more nodes that a blockchain has, the more resilient that blockchain is to attack by outside forces. (13) 

Comparing Factom's number of node operators to Bitcoin's, Factom's currently at 17. (14) However, Bitcoin's number of node operators is currently 10,212. (15) Bitcoin is a more resilient network.

Factom is performing at a minimal level, receiving its revenue from pre-bankruptcy clients such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (16) Factom declared in its bankruptcy documents $7.5M in debt. Between 2018 and 2019, Factom's executive compensation increased by $260,000. (17) Its inability to successfully launch into the Real Estate market, as well as the COVID shutdown, may have contributed its bankruptcy. (18) 

## Recommendations: 

If I were to advise the company, I would not focus on expanding additional products or services. The topic would not be how to thrive, but to survive. From my experience as an accountant, it appears the executives received too much compensation. Factom was asking for Series B funding, and its total funding was $15.5M; an appropriate, average salary for a CEO in this situation would be $160,000. (19) 

According to the bankruptcy filing, we see a lot of "other expenses" that weren't specified. (20) Also, the statement from FastForward, Factom's largest stakeholder, was concerning:

"In an announcement, FastForward director Ed McDermott admitted the company was not altogether certain how Factom Inc. ended in such dire financial straits." (21)
 
Gathering all this information, it may have been a better outcome if Factom it went under receivership, with FastForward taking possession of the company's assets and intellectual property. I believe the executives are to be blamed for some, or perhaps most, of the financial and business strategy missteps that led to Factom's demise.

Again, if I had the power to pivot Factom back to success, I would fire both executives, bring in a team from FastForward to lead the company, and avoid the Real Estate market. We would search for and obtain clients from government and philanthropic entities, since the two largest revenue generating clients were under this umbrella.
